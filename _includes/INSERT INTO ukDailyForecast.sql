There is a more significant chance that tonight the UK may see some auroral activity. The best way to see this is to look in a dark area of the sky, if the weather becomes clear and keep checking every so often, you never know, your patience may be rewarded! Showers die out through the early hours of the morning, and a much drier day follows. Sunny spells potentially anywhere tomorrow, however a few light showers are possible across Northern Ireland and Scotland for a time. Elsewhere it will likely be a dry day and pleasant, warmer as well. Expect highs of 15C to 23C North to South. The few showers that are about will quickly die, leaving a dry and party clear night.
