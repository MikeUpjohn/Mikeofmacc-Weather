Temperatures are however set to continue to rise, and Sunday does look, at the moment, like being the hottest day of 2010 so far.<br/><br/>Overnight into Saturday will stay mild to warm overnight and noticeably muggy making sleeping difficult for some. Temperatures may fall no lower than 16C across the South East. Saturday dawns another sunny and warm one, quickly turning hot across much of England. Elsewhere sunny but slightly cooler. By mid-afternoon some heavy potentially thundery showers are looking increasingly likely to spark across England and Wales, driven by the heat and humidity. Expect temperatures today between 16C and 29C, North to South. Mild to warm and muggy overnight, 8C to 17C.<br/><br/>Sunday is looking like the peak of the heatwave. Initially sunny for all areas, but some heavy showers across more Northern Areas through the afternoon, England and Wales. However one or two thunderstorms are possible, but these will be very isolated. Expect highs of 17C to 31C today, London may record the highest temperature today. Mild and muggy again overnight, 9C to 16C.', 'Mike')
