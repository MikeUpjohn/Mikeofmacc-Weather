                <div class="header"><h4><strong>UK Weather Forecasts</strong></h4></div>
                <p>As, you may have read on the home page, I spend time reading various models and charts and predict what I expect the weather to be like from what I see on each run of the models. I tend to use GFS models, which are updated every 6 hours throughout the day. From reading various GFS charts such as rainfall risk, and CAPE and LI, I try my best to predict the weather for the coming day. I am still new at reading the models but I am gaining experience of what the models mean all the time, and slowly my predictions are becoming better. Although it has been a lot of work, I really enjoy it.</p><br/>
                <div class="header"><h4><strong>About The Forecasts</strong></h4></div>
                <p>These forecasts are written by myself, purely as a hobby as opposed to a service like most forecasting companies. This doesn't mean to say that I will launch this and then forget about it or anything, I will try my best to upload a forecast everyday with the expected weather for the day, but there may however, be circumstances where I cannot issue a forecast for the particular day. I write the forecasts to be as accurate as possible, but forecasts may vary slightly from place to place that you read, due to everybody's separate interpretation of the models. One place may forecast a maximum temperature of 14&deg;C but another place may forecast 15&deg;C as a high.</p><br/>
                <div class="header"><h4><strong>When Are Forecasts Issued?</strong></h4></div>
                <p>Forecasts are most often issued between 2300 and 0000 for the following day, so forecasts for the coming day should be visible from or just before midnight. There are times when this is impractical due to time constraints on my part, or due to a large uncertainty in the weather for the following day. In this case, a weather forecast will be issued on the day, hopefully before 1200. If a weather situation then changes significantly during the day in question after the forecast was issued, a special updated forecast will be made live, with the updated details. Such events are common in summer time, when thunderstorms are a higher risk. A forecast may be updated if thunderstorms begin to break out in areas not forecasted to see them previously, or if they are of a significantly stronger intensity than was forecasted.</p><br/>
                <div class="header"><h4><strong>Current Forecasts</strong></h4></div>
